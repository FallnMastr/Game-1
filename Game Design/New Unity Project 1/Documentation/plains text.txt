You regain consciousness in 
the middle of a grassy field. 
Your ship is destroyed and 
the only remaining bits are 
those used to protect the 
cockpit in case of such an 
emergency.  You see a mountain 
range in the distance and when 
you look closer you think you 
can see the top of a spaceship.
With no other options, you grab 
the two surviving oxygen tanks 
from the cockpit and head out 
across the field towards the 
forest at the base of the 
mountain range.
